	<p class="readmore">Since <em>&lt;canvas&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;video&gt;</em> tags support appeared, we have what we need to make live video processing with HTML and Javascript. But the question was, what about performance? There are a few processing calcs to draw the video in circles, but it happens a lot of times per second (at least 24 because of the 24 fps), so the performance can decrease so much.</p>

	<p>At the beginning I did glowing 3D-like circles, using gradients on canvas, but it was impossible to render at a decent performance, so I decided to make flat circles for better efficiency.</p>

	<p>So, maybe these are not exactly leds, but i think it's a nice way to test browser performance.</p>
