	<p class="readmore">Online Web apps. It's a topic worrying me a long time ago. What we have? Where we go? Why? What should do we do? Web apps are here to stay, and to stay for a long time.</p>

	<h2>Back in the days</h2>

	<p class="readmore">We have to look backward to understand what is happening here. We used to think in the Web as a big big collection of websites or, technically speaking, using servers as Hosting-as-a-Service (i know it's not the term). But what if we use servers as a Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)? Then we can extend our possibilities far far away. Nowadays we have an operating system, software, resources and more on the server side, and better browsers on the client side. We just need our imagination and a lot of work.</p>

	<h2>Big companies know it</h2>

	<p>Web apps are something that really amazes me, but I have to recognize that they can be an easy way to collect people information that sometimes can be used in bad ways. Big companies know it, and also know they can control software piracy through them. Ethical debates aside, we all use pirate software and one thing we should know it's that Web apps are imposible to pirate for a long time. I always use the same example: imagine you open your browser and browse for photoshop.com, then you enter your account name and password, and start using Photoshop right in your browser, storing your files in the cloud or in your computer.</p>

	<p>Well, it's not only future, it's already here. To mention some examples:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gmail/Hotmail. Email applications are probably the first Web apps.</li>
		<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Google Docs (now Drive). It can be a future replacement of Microsoft Office and even more.</span></li>
		<li>Adobe Brackets. It can be a future replacement of NetBeans, Eclipse, Sublime Text, ...</li>
		<li>Grooveshark. Your music everywhere and for free. And yes, they earn a lot of money.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>And it's not only about software. For example Google created the <a title="Chromebook" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/" target="_blank">Chromebook</a> with their own operating system which is based on the Chrome browser and where all apps are Web apps.</p>

	<h2>What can we do?</h2>

	<p>It's at this point where open source software becomes relevant in the probably dirty area of the online Web apps. We need to look at the software as a public service and earn money in another way. I think we, as developers, should create or collaborate with open source projects. Now even more.</p>

	<p>It's because of this I started <a title="Didgeridoo IDE" href="https://github.com/fmvilas/Didgeridoo-IDE" target="_blank">Didgeridoo IDE</a>, an open source project of a web-based IDE. I know that another alternatives exists, such as <a title="Cloud9 IDE" href="http://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9 IDE</a> but while it's nice it's not completely open source.</p>

	<p>If we are moving to 'browser as an operating system' and we want open source Web apps, we should have an IDE working on the browser, being it offline or online.</p>

	<p><strong>Think forward, collaborate with open source software.</strong></p>
